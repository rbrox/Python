#   Write a class called Converter. 
#   The user will pass a length and a unit when declaring an object from 
#   the classâ€”for example, c = Converter (9,'inches'). 
#   The possible units are inches, feet, yards, miles, kilometers, 
#   meters, centimeters, and millimeters. For each of these units 
#   there should be a method that returns the length converted into those units. 
#   For example, using the Converter object created above, 
#   the user could call c.feet() and should get 0.75 as the result.
