#   Write a class called Product.
#   The class should have fields 
#   called name, amount, and price, holding the productâ€™s name, 
#   the number of items of that product in stock, 
#   and the regular price of the product. 
#   There should be a method get_pricethat receives the number of items 
#   to be bought and returns a the cost of buying that many items, 
#   where the regular price is charged for orders of less than 10 items, 
#   a 10% discount is applied for orders of between 10 and 99 items, 
#   and a 20% discount is applied for orders of 100 or more items. 
#   There should also be a method called make_purchase
#   that receives the number of items to be bought and decreases amount by 
#   that much.
